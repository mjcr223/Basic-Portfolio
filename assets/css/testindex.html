                        I am from Athens, GA and have just recently relocated to the Atlanta area to be closer to GA Tech
                        for school. I enjoy music and water sports more than anything. I spend as much time as I can up 
                        on lake Hartwell in South Carolina skiing, wakeboarding and tubing. My favorite bands include Red 
                        Hot Chilli Peppers and Kings of Leon. I am also a huge Outkast and Kendrick Lamar fan. I am excited
                        to finish this bootcamp and rocket myself into an exciting career in the tech field.
